Usage
=====

The *Beyondskins HTML5* theme for Plone is a Diazo Theme based on HTML5 
for Simples Consultoria Website

This is a very basic and clean Plone theme that uses HTML5 tags in your 
structure and gives you a Semantic HTML to start your projects.


HTML
----

Instead a lot of `div>`tags, this theme uses new HTML5 tags like 
`header> section> <nav> and <footer>`


Styles
------


CSS Reset
^^^^^^^^^

Beyondskins HTML5 use `Normalize.css`_ to reset the styles. ``Normalize.css`` 
makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern 
standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.


Grid
^^^^

Beyondskins HTML5 doesn't use any grid system, mainly because the actual grid 
systems make a mess in your html, adding a lot of non semantical tags. And 
because you don't need a grid system to create a website with 2 or 3 columns.

To change columns size, just edit grid.css file included ins this package: ::

    #main {width: 100%;}
    #main-content {width: auto;}
    #column-one {width: 16%;}
    #column-two {width: 30%;}

If you need a grid system, just plug your favorite grid system following their 
instructions. With a little mess in the HTML file you can make any modern grid 
system to work here.
